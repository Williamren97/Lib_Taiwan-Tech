## Lib_Taiwan-Tech - Course Information for Taiwan University of Science and Technology

## Preface

When I came to a university, I first contacted many classes and completed them one by one. In the process, we often collected a lot of information and intelligence.

Some are e-books that need to be searched online. Every time you see a new course, Google will give you the name of the textbook. Some can find it immediately, while others will cost a lot of eyesight. Some are calendar papers or A4 papers. Collecting and producing, holding ideas that can be useful to others, but they need to be explored in various groups or CC98 so that they can be passed down from generation to generation in the hands of the seniors; some are skills that are only comprehended after completing a course. It could have been done more easily at the beginning...

I have also worked hard to collect various course materials, but in the end, some important information is often obtained by chance. This state often makes me feel scared and upset. I also had some methods and summaries after the end of the course, but these ideas have nowhere to tell, and in the end I can only spend the experience of spending time and energy on the long forgotten.

I feel uncomfortable for the repetitive work of so many people fighting alone this year.

I hope that these hidden, uncertain, and word-of-mouth materials and experiences will be turned into open, accessible, and shared materials that everyone can improve and accumulate.

I hope that as long as it is a detour that the predecessors have passed, future generations will not have to go. This is my belief and the reason why I built this project.
